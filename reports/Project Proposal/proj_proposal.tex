\section*{1. Problem Statement}

The changing conditions of Antarctica's Ice Sheets are a significant
factor in the changing global climate, particularly with respect to
rising sea levels [REFERENCE]. In this context, the ability to
accurately model the long-term behaviour of these ice sheets is
of great importance.

\section*{2. Motivations}

Current modelling of Antarctic Ice Sheet measurements - such as
that being undertaked at Victoria University's Antarctic Research
Center \textit{(ARC)} - is commonly based on the use of traditional
statistical models. These models are complex and time-consuming to 
use, limiting the practical scope of the predictive capabilities. 
The use of machine learning models shows promise as an approach due to the
improved computational efficiency of these predictive systems. 
Specifically, the use of Genetic Programming \textit{(GP)} and
Evolutionary Learning techniques provide the greatest potential
due to the increased explainability these methods provide.

\section*{3. Goals}

\section*{4. Evaluation}

\section*{5. Resource Requirements}

No external or additional resources are required for the project as all tooling is publicly and freely accessible.
